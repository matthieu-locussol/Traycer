Traycer is a little Ray-Tracer written in C++. Ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.

*Project inspired by a little ray tracing project I made in C as part of my third year at [Paul Sabatier University](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/).*
